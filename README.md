# Monte_Carlo_Simulation

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to optimize a financial portfolio using historical market data from Yahoo Finance. It leverages Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to identify optimal asset allocations that maximize returns while minimizing risk.

Monte Carlo simulations introduce randomness into the modeling process by generating thousands of possible portfolio combinations. This approach helps to visualize the Efficient Frontierâ€”the set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.

Features
- Historical data retrieval from Yahoo Finance
- Calculation of portfolio returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios
- Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of portfolio combinations
- Visualization of the Efficient Frontier and identification of the optimal portfolio
